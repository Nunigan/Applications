Application for "ML Hardware Design and Verification Engineer".

I have been following Daedalean for a long time and enjoy the progress you are making.
When I first visited your website, I loved your support animals. Even though they are no longer on the site, I am sure they are doing well!
Other topics have caught my attention as well. Recently, I read Maria Pierson's blog post titled "Designing our systems down to the hardware level" and it struck me, that I do the exact same thing. I am also developing high-speed Deep Learning algorithms on FPGA using a hardware description language.

I am a part-time master's student in electrical engineering and I am working as an embedded engineer at the Institute of Microelectronics and Embedded Systems at the University of Applied Sciences OST. My research focus is on embedded AI. 
During my studies, I focused on the following areas: Machine/Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Embedded Software, and Digital Microelectronics.

You can read a blog about my latest project thesis on Deep Learning on an FPGA at the link provided (Hackster.io).

I will finish my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Eastern Switzerland in January 2023 and I am looking for a full-time position starting in February 2023.

I know that this is still far in the future but I am convinced that I am ideally suited for this position. In addition, I will be writing my Master's thesis at the University of Rhode Island in the USA next fall and am looking for a suitable project.
Since our research interests overlap so much, I could image and would love to collaborate with Daedalean already on my master's thesis.

I would be happy to hear from you.

Best Regards,

Michael Schmid
