Application for "ML Hardware Design and Verification Engineer".

I have been following Daedalean for a long time and am always happy to see something new from you. I've always loved seeing your support animals, even though they're no longer on the site, I'm sure they're doing well!
Other issues keep catching my eye. Recently I was reading Maria Pierson's blog post titled "Designing our systems down to the hardware level" and it struck me that I do the exact same thing. I have also been developing high speed deep learning algorithms on FPGA using a hardware description language.

I am a part-time master's student in electrical engineering working as an embedded engineer at the Institute of Microelectronics and Embedded Systems at OST. My research focus is on embedded AI. 
During my studies, I focused on the following areas: Machine/Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Embedded Software, and Digital Microelectronics.

I will graduate in January 2023 with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Applied Sciences Eastern Switzerland and I am looking for a full-time position starting in February 2023.

I know that this is a very long period of time, but I am convinced that I am ideally suited for this position. 
In addition, I will be writing my Master's thesis at the University of Rhode Island in the US next fall and am looking for a suitable project.
Since our research interests overlap very well, I could imagine a collaboration with Daedalean already for my master thesis.

I would be very happy to hear from you.

Yours sincerely,

Michael Schmid
